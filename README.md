# Add-TextField-with-Unique-ID-on-Button-Click
A small and simple script which will create a new text field with an unique ID every time someone clicks on the button.

//In the action file where form will be submitted you can use the names of the field to extract the values
//For example in PHP: $_POST['optionsCount'] will give the number of options and then iterate using a for loop optionsCount times to generate names option1, option2, option3 ... and so on then store these values in an array. $_POST['option1] ...!
